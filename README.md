# Game Memory Wizard

Playing video games are incredible. Sometimes you miss the good ol'days oh the game shark! A lot of the PC gaming cheat applications that exists today are not the easiest to make your own cheats as they require complex coding knowledge. The Game Memory Wizard aims to be a simple and appoachable way to be able to generate cheats for any *single player* gane.

The Game Memory Wizard works by scanning the game's memory and filtering down to the specific place in memory where the value lives. The application stores the information on the file system to be able to access it at later time.

## Features
- Work In Progress

## Special Note:
Because this application reads the memory of the game, it is unable to handle multiplayer games because the memory of a player's health or ammo lives on the server and not the player's computer. Even if you could, don't ruin anyone else's fun. Single Player games only.
